# Taxi Web App

## Introduction
The Taxi Web App was created to showcase my skills in full-stack web development while providing a useful solution for commuters and community members. This project demonstrates my ability to build both client and admin interfaces with dynamic and interactive features.
The Taxi Web App is designed to help people check the availability of taxis in various locations and see the fare for commuting to different destinations. This web app is particularly useful for individuals relocating to new areas for work or school, as it assists with budgeting by providing accurate fare estimates.

This project aims to improve public access to taxi rank information, making it easier for users to plan their journeys. It also benefits the community by promoting awareness of transportation costs and availability.

## Features

### Client Side

### Admin Side
- Create an admin account and log in securely.
- View, add, edit, and delete taxi ranks.
- Manage taxi fare information for different locations.
- Reset admin password.
- Delete admin accounts.

## Technologies Used
The project was developed using the following technologies:
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end.
- JavaScript for client-side interactivity.
- PHP for server-side processing.
- MySQL as the database for storing taxi rank and fare information.
